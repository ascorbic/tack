description: Start a board from a template for the session you're running, and save any board as one.
---

Choose **New board** on the home page and Tack shows its templates: boards laid out for the session you're running, with sections to work in, short prompts, widgets, rules, and facilitation ready to start. Pick one, or a **Blank board**.

Each template shows what's inside before you make a board from it: its sections, widgets, rules and the steps it has ready. Use the arrow keys to move through them, and <kbd>Enter</kbd> on **Create board** to make it.

## The built-in templates

| Template             | What it's for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Planning session** | Everyone proposes on stickies, then you cluster them into themes, discuss in comments, dot-vote with five dots each (👍 on GitHub counts too), and turn the winners into issues and decisions written back as records. The run sheet on the board says how long each part takes. |
| **Retro**            | Went well, to improve, and actions. Silent writing in each, a dot vote on what to improve and a timer to agree actions are ready to start.                                                                                                                                       |
| **Triage**           | An [inbox](/automation/inboxes/) of unlabelled issues, sections per priority, a [rule](/automation/rules/) that puts security issues in P0 and one that puts pull requests beside the issues they mention, and a stale finder.                                                   |
| **Release planning** | Now and Next, with the release's [milestone](/widgets/milestone/), a [release draft](/widgets/release-draft/), open pull requests and a [dependency map](/widgets/dependency-map/) of what's in Now.                                                                             |
| **Roadmap**          | Now, Next and Later, with a [timeline](/widgets/timeline/) of what shipped lately and a vote on what moves into Next.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Incident review**  | A timeline of what happened, then impact, contributing causes, what went well and actions, run blameless.                                                                                                                                                                        |

## Repositories

Templates whose widgets, inboxes or rules read GitHub ask which repositories they're about: type `owner/repo` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> (recent ones are offered). The first is the one widgets about a single repository read, such as the milestone and the release draft; inboxes, rules and lists read them all. Triage and Release planning need one; for the others they're optional, and anything left without a repository is just not set up yet.

## Ready to start

A template's facilitation is in the **Facilitate** menu, under **Ready to start**, in order: silent writing in a section, a dot vote, a timer. **Start** does what you'd do by hand (and starts its timer) and brings its section into view; the next step is highlighted, and a dot on the Facilitate button says steps are waiting. See [Running a session](/facilitation/running-a-session/).

## Last time's action items

Templates with an Actions section, such as Retro, offer **Bring open action items from** one of your boards: the open [action items](/facilitation/action-items/) there come along, with their owners, due dates and issues.

## Saving a board as a template

From the menu beside a board's title, choose **Save as template**. Give it a name and say what it's for. By default it keeps the board's structure: sections, text, widgets, connectors between them, and rules. Turn on **Keep stickies, cards and action items** to keep everything. Dot votes and silent sections become steps ready to start; votes, comments and staged changes never come along.

Saved templates are under **Saved on this Tack** in New board, for everyone on the instance. The repositories its widgets, inboxes and rules read become choices, filled in with the board's own to start with. Anyone who can edit a board can save it; whoever saved a template, or an admin, can delete it.
